Welcome to ViRelAy! In this section, we'll guide you through the process of getting started, covering installation, key concepts, and UI navigation. Read our :doc:`installation` guide for instructions on how to install ViRelAy on your system. Check out our :doc:`basic-usage` guide for an overview of key concepts and UI navigation. If you want a quick start, read our :doc:`example-project` guide, which guides you through the creation of a test project with randomly generated data. You can use the test project to familiarize yourself with the ViRelAy user interface.
