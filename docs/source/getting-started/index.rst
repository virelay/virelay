Are you new to ViRelAy? Here you can find instructions on how to get started with ViRelAy, from how to install it on your system, to key concepts, and how to navigate the UI. If you want to get going fast and do not want to create a project first, you can read the :doc:`example-project` article, which guides you through the creation of a randomly generated project that you can use to familiarize yourself with the ViRelAy user interface.
