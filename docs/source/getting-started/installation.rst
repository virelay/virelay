Installation
============

To get started, you first have to install ViRelAy on your system. The easiest way to install ViRelAy is to use the package available on PyPi, which can be easily installed using your favorite package manager, e.g., ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install virelay

You can also clone the repository to get the latest bleeding-edge development version of ViRelAy, or just to try out the included examples. This can be done like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/virelay/virelay.git
   $ pip install ./virelay
