Installation
============

To get started, you first have to install ViRelAy on your system. The easiest way to install ViRelAy is to use the package of the latest ViRelAy release available on PyPi, which can be easily installed using your favorite Python package manager, e.g., ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install virelay

You can also install ViRelAy from source code to get the latest bleeding-edge development version of ViRelAy, or just to try out the included examples. This can be done by first cloning the Git repository and then using ``pip install`` to install ViRelAy into the current environment.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/virelay/virelay.git
   $ pip install ./virelay
