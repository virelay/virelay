Welcome to the documentation of ViRelAy, an XAI visualization tool for the analysis of the results of spectral relevance analysis (SpRAy) pipelines, as generated by `CoRelAy <https://github.com/virelay/corelay>`_. It runs a small web application to view, explore, and interact with the source data, its attributions, clusterings, and embeddings. ViRelAy is designed to simplify the analysis of classifiers and their underlying datasets. Findings can be imported, exported, and shared with others for easy collaboration. Currently, only image data is supported and attributions are expected to have the same shape as the corresponding input data.
